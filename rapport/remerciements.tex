Many people were involved in the course of this internship, of whom I am forever grateful for the constant help they have been providing me.

First of all, I would like to thanks Mr. Takanobu Nishiura, who accepted me into the lab, as well as all of the lab members, who helped me to integrate into the Japanese culture and country. Especially, Mr. Kota Nakano and Mr. Naoto Kakino helped me a lot during my internship.

I would also like to thank Mrs. Kaori Iwami and the administrative staff of the Creation Core in Ritsumeikan, for the support they provided. As well, the International House resident mentors and staff were very helpful and kind to me.

Finally, I also owe this internship to most of the ENSEIRB-MATMECA staff : Mr. Stéphane Azzopardi, head of the international relations, Mr. Georges Eyrolles, who allowed me to do a research internship, Mrs. Myriam Desainte-Catherine for her support, Mrs. LeAnn Stevens-Larré for preparing us to IELTS,  and all our teachers who help us to become great engineers.
