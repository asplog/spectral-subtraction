\section{Introduction}
This internship was my second in a lab and my first real occasion to try to learn about researching, as well as a wonderful trip in a country and a culture different from France.
The focus of this internship was about signal processing, which is the field of computer science I would like to work in, even if the speech technologies are not my favorite part of it. It called for many of the abilities we learn at school, like the use of \brand{Linux}, \brand{C++} and \brand{Qt} that I had learnt during my \ac{PFA}, as well as some of the knowledge acquired in the Sound Computing (Informatique Sonore) course that we get during the second semester of the second year.

I will first present the university and the laboratory I worked in, and present the objectives of my internship as it was decided beforehand. Then, I will explain most of the software I wrote, and the choices I made during the implementation, as well as the research I have been doing.
