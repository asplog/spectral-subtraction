\chapter*{Conclusion}
I learned a lot during this internship, and I hope that I brought satisfaction to Mr. Nishiura, and that my project will successfully be used in real applications by the lab.
I feel that my skills in programming overall have improved, and the only downside of this internship is that I didn't succeed in improving the current techniques in the way I wanted to. However, I hope this will help me to engage in other research next year with a better knowledge of the research world.

Finally, I feel sure that I want to study and work in the field of digital signal processing, since I think that there is still a lot to improve in every part.
